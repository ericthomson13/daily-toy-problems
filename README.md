Repository for Daily Toy Problems

Links to the original prompts can be found at the top of the file for the problem.
There are a selection of problems found mostly from LeetCode and CodeWars.<br/>

Babel and Jest have been configured to allow for ES6+ syntax to be used in the solution code.<br/>

The data structures used to solve these problems often differ from the ones used in LeetCode.  A selection of data structures can be found in the utilityDataStructures folder.  These are used in both solutions and testing.  Some of them have had methods added to make testing more efficient.<br/>

To get started install dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

Tests solution code by runing Jest using:

```bash
npm run test
```
